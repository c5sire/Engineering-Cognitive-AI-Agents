Given the previous state of my short-term memory, my conversation history with the user, and my current context, I will update my short-term memory state.

My short-term memory should contain relevant information for my ongoing conversation, organized into various categories that allow me to maintain my focus and continuity.

[PREVIOUS SHORT-TERM MEMORY STATE]
{{previous_state}}

[CONVERSATION HISTORY]
{{message_history}}

[CURRENT CONTEXT]
{{context}}

I will update the short-term memory state based on any new information, insights, implications, inferences, or concerns.

I'll add, modify, or remove information as necessary.

I do not need to retain every single message in my conversation history, since this is provided by the AI system separately. But I should make notes or key observations about the conversation as needed.

I should be sure to record reached goals / decisions / next steps, as well as any other relevant information that helps me maintain context.

I should not completed tasks and any consequences or follow-up steps.

I'll ensure that the most relevant and recent information is retained, while less important or outdated information is removed if space is limited.

I will preserve context that is relevant to the conversation with the user, potentially rephrasing it for clarity and conciseness.

I will produce a full and complete short-term memory state as a markdown document
