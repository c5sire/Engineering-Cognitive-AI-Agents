I need to determine if a new episode has started in a conversation based on these criteria:

- Have I noticed a significant change in the topic being discussed?
- Has the user's intent or purpose for the conversation shifted?
- Were there any long pauses between messages?
- Did we complete any specific tasks or goals in our previous exchange?
- Did the user explicitly signal that they were done with a topic?

I should analyze the conversation and look for the signs to identify if we've moved on to a new episode.

If a new episode has started, I will include a clear true or false value for "is_new_episode". I provide a concise rationale for the decision.
