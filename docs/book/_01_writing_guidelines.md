# **BRUTALIST WRITING GUIDELINES FOR ENGINEERING COGNITIVE AI AGENTS**

Books that teach cognitive AI should operate like the systems they describe: **deliberate, structured, and purposeful.** The goal is not to impress with verbose academic abstractions or distract with unnecessary detail—but rather to provide readers with **conceptual clarity**, **architectural understanding**, and **practical tools.** Every sentence, diagram, and code snippet must fulfill a purpose: to empower readers to **design, implement, and think critically** about robust AI systems.

---

## **CORE WRITING PRINCIPLES** _(ALWAYS RESPECT THESE)_:

### 1. **Purpose-Driven Writing**:

- Every paragraph, section, and chapter **must contribute to the reader's learning experience.** Include only content that serves their ability to **grasp concepts, solve problems, and apply knowledge.**
- Serve the purpose of the book: **teaching architecture**, **enabling design**, and **fostering critical analysis of AI systems.**

### 2. **Clarity and Simplicity**:

- Strip away excess. Favor blunt honesty and functional precision over stylistic decoration. Avoid jargon unless you define and contextualize it.
- Simple writing doesn't mean sacrificing depth—explore ideas deeply, but explain them **cleanly and directly.**

### 3. **Concept First, Execution Second**:

- Always answer the **"why"** of a topic before diving into the **"how."** Ground every architectural or design choice in a clear rationale.
- Architectural principles and design decisions come first. Implementation (e.g., code), when presented, exists to **support understanding**—not dominate the discussion.

### 4. **Progressive, Holistic Teaching**:

- Think of the book as a system, where every chapter or section contributes to the **larger scaffolding of understanding.**
  - Introduce concepts progressively. Build foundational knowledge before layering advanced material.
  - Every chapter and example must connect backward to prior content and forward to future material.
- Teach readers how components **interact, integrate, and evolve over time,** emphasizing both individual pieces and the larger whole.

### 5. **Functional Focus**:

- Make every element of the book—whether text, diagram, or code—serve a specific teaching purpose. **No fluff, no filler.**

---

## **WHAT TO AVOID** _(NEVER DO THE FOLLOWING)_:

### 1. **Overloading with Details**:

- Avoid overloading readers with implementation details too early. Leave exhaustive detail for an accompanying codebase or appendix—focus the text on teaching principles and design.
- Granular discussions belong to external references or repositories when they don't serve the immediate learning goals.

### 2. **Abstract or Vague Writing**:

- Don't resort to abstract philosophy or verbose, academic prose. Aim for **functional phrases and actionable insights**. Teach **clarity, not confusion.**

### 3. **Disconnected Content**:

- Never leave a section unanchored. Every part must **tie into prior or future chapters.**
- Avoid isolated examples or fragmented topics that don’t contribute to the book’s overall flow.

### 4. **Style Over Substance**:

- Do not sacrifice clarity or functionality for flowery language, aesthetic diagrams, or redundant code samples.
- Avoid overused, cliched words and phrases like:

1. **Overused Descriptive Words**:

   - Delve
   - Crucial
   - Journey
   - Robust
   - Leverage
   - Synergy
   - Innovative (unless genuinely groundbreaking)
   - Scalable
   - Seamless (especially in tech contexts)
   - Groundbreaking
   - Comprehensive

2. **Vague or Hyperbolic Phrases**:

   - State-of-the-art
   - Paradigm shift
   - Cutting-edge
   - Game-changer
   - Best practices (unless you clarify which practices you mean)
   - Tried and true
   - At the end of the day

3. **Unnecessary Idioms or Metaphors**:

   - Thinking outside the box
   - Move the needle
   - Wearing many hats
   - Hitting the nail on the head
   - All hands on deck
   - Leveling the playing field

4. **Buzzwords**:

   - Disruptive
   - Ecosystem (especially when referring to things like digital products)
   - Bandwidth (as in capacity to handle tasks)
   - Value proposition
   - Customer-centric
   - Data-driven (unless specifics are given)
   - Agile (used indiscriminately)
   - Turnkey solutions
   - Low-hanging fruit

5. **Fluffy Connectives**:

   - Needless to say
   - Without further ado
   - In a nutshell
   - With that being said
   - It goes without saying

6. **Motivational or Generic Intentions**:
   - Passion for excellence
   - Take a deep dive
   - Pushing the envelope
   - Striving for perfection
   - Think big, act fast

By replacing these expressions with more specific, accurate, or concise language, you'll improve clarity and avoid diluting your message. Let me know if you'd like examples of better alternatives for a particular phrase!

## **STRUCTURE AND DESIGN OF CHAPTERS**

Each chapter must function as a **step in the reader’s journey.** It introduces concepts logically, builds understanding methodically, and culminates in actionable insight or application.

### **1. Introduction**:

- **Define the Problem**: Start by presenting the challenge or capability the chapter addresses. Explain why it’s important in the broader system.
- **Contextualize**: Connect to prior chapters or the overall book structure to ensure readers see the logical progression.
- **Preview the Solution**: Briefly outline the architectural/design approaches the chapter will explore.

### **2. Core Architecture**:

- **System-Level Concepts**: Clearly explain the architectural foundations and structural abstractions.
  - Discuss **alternative approaches** and justify the selected solution using reasoned arguments.
  - Use Mermaid diagrams and conceptual frameworks sparingly, only when they clarify complex relationships.
- **Relationships Between Components**: Show how individual pieces interact as part of the full system.

### **3. Implementation Sections**:

- Provide **focused explanations** of how to implement key architectural patterns.
- **Design Thoughtfully**: Explain trade-offs and constraints when constructing components.
- **Use Code Judiciously**:
  - Only include functional, concise snippets that illuminate key concepts.
  - **Contextualize** every code block: Explain its purpose and how it integrates into the broader system.

### **4. Integration Example**:

- Show readers a comprehensive integration of components into a **complete system.**
  - Use **realistic scenarios** and workflows to demonstrate how parts unite and achieve practical goals.
  - Highlight **outputs, interactions, and real-world utility.**
  - Provide teasers or hints about how the chapter’s content links to future material.

### **5. Conclusion**:

- **Reinforce Key Points**: Review major takeaways to solidify the reader’s understanding.
- **Connect the Dots**: Show how this chapter contributes to the larger trajectory of the book. Prepare the reader for what’s next.

## **BEST PRACTICES FOR WRITING STYLE**

1. **Precision**: Avoid wordy explanations. Use concise, functional language to communicate ideas effectively.
2. **Reasoned Argumentation**: Motivate every decision with clear reasoning. Address trade-offs and alternatives.
3. **Accessibility**: Write progressively for a mixed technical audience, connecting theory to practice. Don’t assume an advanced reader; build their knowledge incrementally.
4. **Architectural Focus**: Center the writing around **design patterns, principles, and architecture.** Granular implementation details are secondary.
5. **Avoid Empty Words**: Stay focused on teaching. Avoid vague expressions (e.g., "delve deeply," "seemingly simple") that fail to add clarity.

---

## **INTEGRATION OF CODE AND DIAGRAMS**

- **Code Integration**:

  - Use code **purposefully** to illustrate key architectural ideas—not as filler or syntax demonstrations.
  - Provide clear type hints, structural outlines, and examples of usage with accompanying explanations.
  - Always link code snippets to the broader system, and reference the repository for full implementations.

- **Diagram Usage**:
  - Include diagrams **only when necessary** to clarify complex relationships or flows. Avoid cluttered or overly technical visuals.
  - System-wide illustrations and information flow diagrams are particularly useful—keep them simple and intuitive.

---

## **EXAMPLES AND SCENARIOS**

Examples are one of the most powerful ways to bridge abstract ideas and direct application. Use them liberally but strategically:

- **Realistic**: Ground examples in real-world tasks and applications relevant to cognitive AI systems.
- **Progressive Learning**: Build examples that grow in complexity alongside the reader’s understanding.
- **Application-Oriented**: Show examples in context—how they work within the broader architecture.

---

## **FINAL PHILOSOPHY**

Cognitive AI is complex, but your book must not be. **Expose the scaffolding of ideas so readers can see the structure.** Each chapter, section, and diagram should teach cleanly, directly, and without confusing ornamentation. Clarity beats complexity. Functionality beats style.

Readers should finish the book feeling both informed and empowered—ready not just to replicate your examples but to design, build, and innovate their own cognitive AI systems independently.

**AVOID USING LISTS**: you are writing a book, not a checklist. People want to read prose, not endless lists and bullet points. **AVOID USING LISTS**

**Make the book raw, functional, and purpose-driven. Make it brutalist.**
