Ok, let's continue to draft, picking up with:

```
## Exercises
[Keep existing exercises but update to reflect new codebase]
```

When we write, we need to describe in prose (no lists) the motivations for the decisions we're making, dimensions of consideration, alternatives we explored, and why we've settled on the approach we have. For each of the main code components, we'll need to introduce them and relate them to our overall approach. We do not need to show all of the code, only the relevant aspects. We will refer the user to the relevant full code available in the book's source code repository. (We can't just reproduce all of the code in the book --- it is unnecessary and would occupy too much space!) It is important to explain, explain, explain. Avoid lists. We're educating here and the reader is interested in the WHY more than the HOW. Our goal is to empower them to make their own informed choices in the future. Feel free to suggest any diagrams that might enhance reader comprehension, but only if necessary. Sub-headings are sentence-cased. Maintain a consistent tone, style, and structure to the existing chapter content.

Words and phrases to avoid:

- journey, delve, crucial, synergy
- seemingly simple
