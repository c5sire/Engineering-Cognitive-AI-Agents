# Title: Engineering Cognitive AI Agents

## Core Philosophy

1. **Multi-Agent Architecture from the Start**
   - Systems built as collaborative networks of specialized agents
   - Based on cognitive science principles (Society of Mind)
   - Enables natural scaling and capability extension
   - Clear separation of concerns through specialized agents

1.5 **Multi-Agent Architecture: A Considered Choice**

- Pros:

  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Natural parallelization
  - Easier testing and validation
  - Modular development
  - Failure isolation
  - Aligns with cognitive science models

- Cons:

  - Increased complexity
  - Communication overhead
  - More moving parts
  - Higher initial development effort
  - Resource management challenges

- Resolution:
  - Configuration-driven approach mitigates complexity
  - No dynamic class generation in production
  - Core agents defined in codebase
  - New capabilities through configuration
  - Balance between flexibility and stability

2. **Configuration-Driven Systems**

   - Agents defined through configuration rather than dynamic code generation
   - Behaviors, prompts, and capabilities managed as data
   - Self-modification through configuration adaptation
   - Safe and controlled system evolution

3. **Three-Pattern Communication Architecture**

3.1 **Communication Pattern Analysis**

- **Conversational Pattern**

  - Pros:
    - Natural for LLMs (their core competency)
    - Maintains context and reasoning chains
    - Flexible and adaptable
    - Supports clarification and refinement
    - Good for complex, nuanced interactions
    - Easy to debug (human-readable)
  - Cons:
    - More token/resource intensive
    - Less structured/predictable
    - Harder to compose programmatically
    - May drift or lose focus
    - Context window limitations

- **Function-Calling Pattern**

  - Pros:
    - Clear contracts/interfaces
    - Easier to test and validate
    - More efficient (focused I/O)
    - Natural composition/chaining
    - Better type safety
    - Easier integration with traditional code
  - Cons:
    - Less flexible
    - May miss nuanced interactions
    - Requires more upfront design
    - Could become overly rigid
    - May need frequent interface updates

- **Event-Based Pattern**

  - Pros:
    - Loose coupling
    - Good for system-wide notifications
    - Supports asynchronous operations
    - Natural for monitoring/logging
  - Cons:

    - Can become complex to track
    - Potential for event storms
    - May need careful ordering

      3.2 **Hybrid Implementation Strategy**

- Use function-calling for:

  - Well-defined, atomic operations
  - Performance-critical paths
  - Data transformation
  - System integration points
  - Parallel processing

- Use conversational for:

  - Complex reasoning
  - Creative tasks
  - Uncertainty handling
  - Meta-cognitive processes
  - Learning/adaptation

- Use events for:
  - System state changes
  - Progress notifications
  - Error broadcasting
  - Resource management
  - Monitoring/logging
