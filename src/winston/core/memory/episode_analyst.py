"""Episode Analyst: Specialist agent for cognitive episode boundary detection.

The Episode Analyst plays a crucial role in Winston's memory system by detecting
natural boundaries in cognitive context. Just as humans naturally segment experiences
into distinct episodes, this specialist analyzes interactions to determine when
context shifts occur and what information should be preserved across these boundaries.

Architecture Overview:

```

Design Philosophy:
The Episode Analyst addresses a fundamental challenge in cognitive architectures:
determining when to maintain current context versus starting fresh. This mirrors
human cognitive processes where we naturally segment experiences into distinct
episodes while maintaining relevant connections between them.

Example Scenarios:

1. Preference Update
   Input: "Actually, I've switched to tea"
   Context: Previous discussion about coffee preferences
   Analysis: Same episode (beverage preferences)
   Preserve: Morning routine context, family patterns

2. Topic Shift
   Input: "Let's discuss the home renovation project"
   Context: Previous beverage preference discussion
   Analysis: New episode (complete context shift)
   Preserve: None (clean context break)

3. Related Shift
   Input: "Speaking of morning routines, I've started exercising"
   Context: Previous discussion about morning beverages
   Analysis: Partial new episode
   Preserve: Temporal context (morning patterns)

Key Architectural Principles:
- Focus purely on episode detection (single responsibility)
- Provide clear boundary signals to memory coordinator
- Identify critical context to preserve
- Support natural cognitive segmentation

The specialist's system prompt guides the LLM to:
1. Analyze message content against current context
2. Identify significant context shifts
3. Determine what context remains relevant
4. Signal clear episode boundaries

This design enables sophisticated context management while maintaining:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Clear cognitive boundaries
- Natural context preservation
- Flexible episode detection

Implementation Note:
While the Episode Analyst makes sophisticated cognitive decisions about
context boundaries, it performs no direct memory operations. It simply
signals its analysis to the Memory Coordinator, which orchestrates any
necessary memory updates. This separation of concerns ensures the analyst
can focus purely on its cognitive role while leaving memory management
to appropriate specialists.
